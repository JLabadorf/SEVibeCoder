      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This script is designed to open a door every 5 seconds in Space Engineers using an in-game programmable block. Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **`public void Main(string argument, UpdateType updateSource)`**: This is the main entry point of your script. It's executed every game tick or when triggered by certain events, depending on the `UpdateType` and `Runtime.UpdateFrequency`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **`TimeSpan interval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5);`**:  This line defines the desired interval between door openings, set to 5 seconds. `TimeSpan` is used for representing time intervals.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **`DateTime lastRunTime;`**:  This variable will store the last time the door was opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Storage Persistence (for remembering the last run time):**\n",
      "    *   **`if (Storage != null && Storage != \"\")`**:  This checks if there's any data stored in the programmable block's `Storage` string from previous runs. `Storage` is a string that persists between script executions, allowing you to save data.\n",
      "    *   **`if (DateTime.TryParse(Storage, out lastRunTime))`**:  If there's stored data, it attempts to parse it as a `DateTime` object. `DateTime.TryParse` is used to safely convert a string to a `DateTime`.\n",
      "    *   **`else { lastRunTime = DateTime.Now; }`**: If parsing fails (meaning the stored data is not a valid `DateTime` or there's no stored data initially), `lastRunTime` is initialized to the current time (`DateTime.Now`).\n",
      "    *   **`else { lastRunTime = DateTime.Now; }`**: This is for the very first run when `Storage` is initially null or empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Time Check: `if (DateTime.Now - lastRunTime >= interval)`**:\n",
      "    *   This is the core logic for the timer. It calculates the time elapsed since `lastRunTime` and checks if it's greater than or equal to the `interval` (5 seconds).\n",
      "    *   `DateTime.Now - lastRunTime` gives a `TimeSpan` representing the elapsed time.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Door Access and Opening:**\n",
      "    *   **`List<IMyDoor> doorList = new List<IMyDoor>();`**:  Creates an empty list to store door blocks. `IMyDoor` is the interface for door blocks in Space Engineers scripting.\n",
      "    *   **`GridTerminalSystem.GetBlocksOfType<IMyDoor>(doorList);`**: This is the crucial line for accessing blocks in the game world.\n",
      "        *   `GridTerminalSystem` is the central system for interacting with blocks on your grid.\n",
      "        *   `GetBlocksOfType<IMyDoor>(doorList)` retrieves all blocks of type `IMyDoor` (doors) on the same grid as the programmable block and adds them to the `doorList`.\n",
      "    *   **`if (doorList.Count > 0)`**: Checks if any doors were found.\n",
      "    *   **`IMyDoor door = doorList[0];`**:  If doors are found, this line gets the *first* door in the list.  **Important:** If you have multiple doors, this script will only open the first one it finds. You might need to modify this to target a specific door if you have multiple doors and don't want to open them all. You could use `GridTerminalSystem.GetBlockWithName(\"Door Name\")` for a specific door.\n",
      "    *   **`door.OpenDoor();`**: This is the method call that actually opens the door. `OpenDoor()` is a method available in the `IMyDoor` interface (as indicated in your context).\n",
      "    *   **`Echo(\"Door opened!\");`**:  This is optional. `Echo()` displays text on the programmable block's screen. It's useful for providing feedback that the script is working.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Error Handling (No Doors Found):**\n",
      "    *   **`else { Echo(\"No doors found!\"); }`**: If `doorList.Count` is 0, it means no doors were found on the grid. This `Echo` message will display \"No doors found!\" on the programmable block screen, helping you diagnose if there's an issue (like no doors on the grid or a typo in the block type).\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  **Storing the Current Time: `Storage = DateTime.Now.ToString();`**:\n",
      "    *   After successfully opening the door (or attempting to), this line updates the `Storage` string with the current time (`DateTime.Now.ToString()`).  This ensures that the `lastRunTime` is updated for the next time the script runs, so the 5-second interval is measured correctly from the last door opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "9.  **`public Program()`**: This is the constructor of your programmable block script. It's executed once when the script is compiled or when the programmable block is first initialized.\n",
      "    *   **`Runtime.UpdateFrequency = UpdateFrequency.Update10;`**: This is crucial for making the script run periodically.\n",
      "        *   `Runtime.UpdateFrequency` controls how often the `Main()` method is executed.\n",
      "        *   `UpdateFrequency.Update10` tells the game to run the `Main()` method approximately every 10 game ticks. In Space Engineers, there are roughly 60 ticks per second, so `Update10` means the script will run about 6 times per second (every ~0.16 seconds).  This is frequent enough for a 5-second timer to be relatively accurate.  You don't need to run it every tick (`UpdateFrequency.Update1`) for a 5-second interval, which would be less efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to use this script in Space Engineers:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Place a Programmable Block:** Build a programmable block on your ship or station.\n",
      "2.  **Open Programmable Block Interface:** Access the programmable block's control panel.\n",
      "3.  **Click \"Edit\":** Open the script editor.\n",
      "4.  **Clear Existing Code:** Delete any default code in the editor.\n",
      "5.  **Paste the Script:** Copy and paste the C# code provided above into the script editor.\n",
      "6.  **Click \"Compile\":** Compile the script to check for errors. If there are no errors, it will compile successfully.\n",
      "7.  **Click \"Run\":**  Run the script.\n",
      "8.  **Ensure Doors are Present:** Make sure you have at least one door block on the same grid as the programmable block.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door (specifically the first door the script finds) should now open every 5 seconds. You can adjust the `interval` variable in the script to change the opening frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **First Door Found:**  The script currently opens the *first* door it finds. If you have multiple doors and want to control a specific door, you'll need to modify the script to identify doors by name or some other criteria.\n",
      "*   **Power Consumption:** Programmable blocks consume a small amount of power when running scripts, especially with `UpdateFrequency` set. However, for a simple script like this running at `Update10`, the power consumption is minimal.\n",
      "*   **Error Handling:** The script includes basic error handling (checking for doors and displaying \"No doors found!\"). You could add more robust error handling if needed, but for this simple task, it's generally sufficient.\n",
      "*   **Modifications:** You can easily modify this script to:\n",
      "    *   Toggle the door instead of just opening it (use `door.ToggleDoor();`).\n",
      "    *   Control multiple doors (loop through `doorList` or use more specific block retrieval methods).\n",
      "    *   Use different intervals.\n",
      "    *   Trigger the door opening based on other conditions (e.g., sensor activation) instead of a timer.\n",
