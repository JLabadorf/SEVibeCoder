# KYLEWARE - Your Space Engineers Scripting Assistant üõ†Ô∏è

**Ask me anything about Space Engineers Code!**

KYLEWARE is a chatbot designed to help you with scripting in Space Engineers using the MDK-SE (Modular Development Kit - Space Engineers) framework.  Whether you're a seasoned scripter or just starting out, KYLEWARE can answer your questions about the Space Engineers API, MDK-SE concepts, and general scripting techniques within the game.

This chatbot is built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, leveraging the comprehensive knowledge base of the [MDK-SE Wiki](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/wiki).

**Support the development of KYLEWARE!**

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

KYLEWARE uses a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide informative answers to your questions:

1.  **Knowledge Base:** The chatbot's knowledge is derived from the [MDK-SE Wiki](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE/wiki), a valuable resource for Space Engineers scripting.
2.  **Vector Indexing:**  The content of the MDK-SE Wiki is processed and indexed using embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers. This creates a searchable vector index using FAISS, allowing for efficient semantic similarity searches.
3.  **Query Understanding:** When you ask a question, the chatbot uses the same Sentence Transformer model to encode your query into a vector embedding.
4.  **Information Retrieval:**  The chatbot searches the FAISS vector index to find the most relevant chunks of text from the MDK-SE Wiki that are semantically similar to your query embedding.
5.  **Answer Generation (RAG):** The retrieved context chunks from the MDK-SE Wiki, along with your original question, are fed into the Gemini API (a powerful language model). Gemini then generates a concise and helpful answer based on the provided context.
6.  **User Interface:**  The entire process is wrapped in a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, making it easy to ask questions and receive answers directly in your browser.

## Technology Stack üíª

KYLEWARE is built using the following technologies:

*   **Streamlit:**  For creating the interactive web application and user interface.
*   **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):** For efficient and fast vector similarity search, indexing the MDK-SE Wiki content.
*   **Sentence Transformers:** For generating high-quality text embeddings, enabling semantic understanding of both the Wiki content and user queries.
*   **Gemini API (Google AI):**  For the generative language model that formulates the final answers based on retrieved context.
*   **Python:** The primary programming language for the entire application.

## Setup and Running Instructions üöÄ

To run KYLEWARE locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url] # Replace with the actual repository URL
    cd [repository-directory] # Navigate into the cloned directory
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    It's recommended to create a virtual environment first.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up Gemini API Key:**
    You need a Google Cloud Gemini API key to use the generative capabilities.
    *   Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.  For example, in your terminal:
        ```bash
        export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" # Linux/macOS
        set GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE      # Windows
        ```
        Alternatively, you can set it in your system's environment variables.

4.  **Prepare FAISS Index and Metadata:**
    You need to generate the FAISS index (`faiss_index.bin`) and metadata (`metadata.json`) files. Run the indexing script (e.g., `indexing_script.py`) provided in the repository. This script will process the MDK-SE Wiki data and create these files. **Ensure these files are in the same directory as `app.py` and `helpers.py`.**

5.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

6.  **Access in Browser:**
    Open your web browser and go to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
